# Link State Protocol Visualization

## 1. Description
This is an interactive web application that visualizes the Link State Protocol (LSP), a routing protocol used in computer networks. The application provides a user-friendly interface to understand how routers communicate and build their routing tables using the Dijkstra's algorithm. Users can:


- Add/remove routers and links
- Set link costs
- Create and visualize network topologies
- Visualize the routing process
- See how routing tables are built
- Understand the path selection process

## 2. Live Demo

## 3. Steps to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd link-state-protocol
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Usage Instructions
1. The application will open in your default web browser
2. Use the interface to:
   - Add routers by clicking on the canvas
   - Create links between routers
   - Set link costs
   - Visualize the routing process
3. The visualization will show how routers exchange information and build their routing tables
