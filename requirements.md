  2. Calculate shortest paths to all destinations
  3. Update routing table
  4. Visualize path calculation process
- [ ] Routing Table Management
  1. Store next-hop information
  2. Update costs
  3. Handle unreachable destinations

## 7. Visualization Enhancements

  1. Show Hello packets as small spheres
  2. Show LSAs as cubes
  3. Animate packet movement between nodes
  4. Color-code different packet types
- [ ] Network State Display
  1. Show active/inactive nodes
  2. Highlight current links and costs
  3. Display current routing tables
  4. Show topology database contents
